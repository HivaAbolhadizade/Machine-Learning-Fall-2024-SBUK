# HW1 – Analyzing Titanic Survival Rates

## Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic dataset to explore factors influencing passenger survival. Using statistical analysis and visualizations, the study focuses on demographic and socio-economic variables such as **gender**, **passenger class**, **age**, and **family size**.

## Key Findings
- **Gender:** Women had a survival rate of **82.5%**, compared to **12.9%** for men.  
- **Passenger Class:** First-class passengers had the highest survival rate (**57.3%**), while third-class had the lowest (**27.0%**).  
- **Age:** Children aged 0–12 had the highest survival rate (**55.3%**); older adults (61+) had the lowest (**24.0%**).  
- **Family Size:** Small families (1–3 members) had better outcomes, with families of three surviving at **72.1%**; large families (5+) had low survival rates (~20%).  

## Dataset
The dataset originates from Kaggle's Titanic competition and contains 1,306 cleaned records after handling missing values and removing irrelevant features.

## Conclusion
Survival was most strongly associated with:
- Being **female**
- Belonging to **first class**
- Being **a child**
- Traveling in a **small family group**

These findings illustrate how socio-economic status, demographics, and group size influenced survival during the Titanic disaster.
